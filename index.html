                In the age of fast-moving digital trends, it is easier to buy into viral moments but harder to 
                cultivate a wardrobe that feels authentic. The rise of TikTok Shop has accelerated the trend 
                cycle — one week, it's all about clean-girl minimalism; the next, it's coquette bows and indie 
                sleaze. While some sources of inspiration encourage creativity and longevity, others fuel 
                impulsive, short-lived purchases.

                With fashion shifting at breakneck speed, where are people actually finding their inspiration? 
                And in a world of algorithm-driven style, is it still possible to develop a look that's truly 
                your own? Let's take a closer look at how the trend cycle shapes our choices and what it really 
                means to dress with intention in the digital age.

            <p>Whether your style icon is Sandy Liang or Brigitte Bardot, your fashion sense is defined by who or what you're interacting with. Let's see how you feel about a few popular sources of inspiration to get a sense of what your algorithm may be feeding you.</p>
            <h2>Would you wear this?</h2>

                <p>In the second half of 2023, this cropped "Brasil" baby tee was everywhere. A staple of the soccer-inspired "blokecore" aesthetic that started trending in 2022,  vintage jerseys have been selling for twice their value on reseller sites like Depop for a few years now. And after celebrities like Hailey Bieber, SZA, and Kali Uchis all posted photos wearing similar Brasil jerseys, it was only a matter of time before fast fashion retailers like Shein started mass-manufacturing a cheap alternative.</p>
                <p>If they're your style, a jersey is a good staple to have that you can wear a lot of different ways. But if you're just buying one to follow a trend, you're less likely to invest in one that won't end up in a landfill after five or so wears. When drawing inspiration from social media trends, try to keep in mind the longevity of a piece and whether you'll still like it when the trend is through.</p>

                <p>Carrie Bradshaw of "Sex and the City" has been a TV style icon ever since the show first aired in 1998. Although most of her looks were trendy around the time they aired, most fans would agree that they've largely stood the test of time.</p>

                In a world where trends are dictated by algorithms and the latest viral moment, not every source of 
                inspiration encourages mindful consumption—some lead to fleeting purchases that don't integrate well 
                into a long-term wardrobe. The key to sustainable and intentional fashion isn't about chasing every 
                new aesthetic. Whether your style influences come from the streets, social media, runways, or film, 
                what matters most is finding inspiration that truly resonates with you. Because at the end of the day, 
                the best style isn't just trendy—it's timeless.
