        <h1 class="title">What's shaping your wardrobe?</h1>
        <p class="title">Since 2022, fashion and culture critics have taken to the internet to proclaim the death 
            of personal style—blaming social media algorithms and fast fashion for turning individuality into 
            a thing of the past. But where does your style really come from?</p>

                In the age of fast-moving digital trends, it's easier than ever to buy into viral moments—but harder 
                to cultivate a wardrobe that feels uniquely yours. </p>

            <p>
                The rise of TikTok Shop has accelerated the trend cycle: one week, it's all about clean-girl minimalism; 
                the next, it's coquette bows and indie sleaze. Some sources of inspiration encourage creativity and 
                longevity, while others fuel impulsive, short-lived purchases. Let's take a closer look at how 
                trends influence our choices—and what it really means to dress with intention in the digital age. </p>

                <h3>You might be a victim of microtrends!</h3>

                <p>In the second half of 2023, this cropped "Brasil" baby tee was everywhere. A staple of the 
                    soccer-inspired "blokecore" aesthetic that first gained traction in 2022, vintage jerseys 
                    were already selling for twice their value on resale platforms like Depop. But after celebrities 
                    like Hailey Bieber, SZA, and Kali Uchis were spotted in Brasil jerseys, it didn't take long for 
                    fast fashion brands like Shein to mass-produce a cheaper alternative.</p>

                <p>If this piece aligns with your style, a jersey can be a versatile staple in your wardrobe. 
                    But if you're only buying it to keep up with a trend, chances are it will end up in a landfill 
                    after just a few wears. When drawing inspiration from social media trends, consider whether a 
                    piece has longevity—will you still love it once the hype fades? </p>

                <h3>You're in good company!</h3>

                <p>Carrie Bradshaw from Sex and the City has been a TV style icon ever since the show first 
                    aired in 1998. While many of her outfits were trendy at the time, most fans would agree 
                    they've stood the test of time.</p>
                
                <p>If you're influenced by fashion in film and television, you might want to think less about specific 
                    pieces and more about curating a cohesive aesthetic—like Carrie's effortlessly bold looks. 
                    But loving a character's wardrobe doesn't mean you need to copy it exactly. If you're inspired 
                    by Carrie's style, you don't have to splurge on a mink coat or snakeskin boots—focus on pieces 
                    that fit seamlessly into your own wardrobe.</p>

            <h2>What does this all mean?</h2>
            
            <p> In a world where trends are dictated by algorithms and viral moments, 
                not every source of inspiration encourages mindful consumption. Some lead to fleeting
                purchases that don't integrate well into a long-term wardrobe. </p>

            <p>The key to sustainable and intentional fashion isn't about chasing every new aesthetic.
                Whether your style influences come from street style, social media, the runway, 
                or film, what matters most is finding inspiration that resonates with you. Because 
                at the end of the day, the best style isn't just trendy—it's timeless.</p>
